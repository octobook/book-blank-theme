    Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance, that was
    never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in
    discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary, and
    yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to
    his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye;
    something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which
    spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but
    more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with
    himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for
    vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the
    doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance for
    others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure
    of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined
    to help rather than to reprove.
    "I incline to Cain's heresy," he used to say quaintly: "I let my
    brother go to the devil in his own way." In this character, it was
    frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the
    last good influence in the lives of down-going men. And to such as
    these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a
    shade of change in his demeanour.

    No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was
    undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be
    founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a
    modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands
    of opportunity; and that was the lawyer's way. His friends were
    those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his
    affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no
    aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt, the bond that united him to
    Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about
    town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in
    each other, or what subject they could find in common. It was
    reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that
    they said nothing, looked singularly dull, and would hail with
    obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men
    put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief
    jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure,
    but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy
    them uninterrupted.

    It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a
    by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and
    what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the
    week-days. The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed, and all
    emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of
    their gains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that
    thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling
    saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms
    and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in
    contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and
    with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and
    general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased
    the eye of the passenger.

    Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east, the line
    was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point, a
    certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the
    street. It was two stories high; showed no window, nothing but a
    door on the lower story and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on
    the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and
    sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell
    nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the
    recess and struck matches on
    the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had
    tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no
    one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair
    their ravages.

    Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street;
    but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his
    cane and pointed.

    "Did you ever remark that door?" he asked; and when his companion
    had replied in the affirmative, "It is connected in my mind," added
    he, "with a very odd story."

    "Indeed?" said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, "and
    what was that?"

    "Well, it was this way," returned Mr. Enfield: "I was coming home
    from some place at the end of the world, about three o'clock of a
    black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where
    there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after
    street, and all the folks asleep--street after street, all lighted
    up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church--till at
    last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens
    and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, I saw
    two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a
    good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was
    running as hard as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the
    two ran into one another naturally enough at the
    corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man
    trampled calmly over the child's body and left her screaming on
    the ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see.
    It wasn't like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a
    view-halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought
    him back to where there was already quite a group about the
    screaming child. He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but
    gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like
    running. The people who had turned out were the girl's own family;
    and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been sent, put in his
    appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened,
    according to the Sawbones; and there you might have supposed would
    be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken
    a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So had the child's
    family, which was only natural. But the doctor's case was what
    struck me. He was the usual cut-and-dry apothecary, of no particular
    age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent, and about as
    emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every
    time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick and
    white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just
    as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question,
    we did the next best. We told the man we could
    and would make such a scandal out of this, as should make his name
    stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or
    any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time,
    as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him
    as best we could, for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a
    circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle,
    with a kind of black, sneering coolness--frightened too, I could
    see that--but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. 'If you
    choose to make capital out of this accident,' said he, 'I am
    naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,' says
    he. 'Name your figure.' Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds
    for the child's family; he would have clearly liked to stick out;
    but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and
    at last he struck. The next thing was to get the money; and where
    do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?--
    whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter
    of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts's,
    drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can't mention,
    though it's one of the points of my story, but it was a name at
    least very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but
    the signature was good for more than that, if it was only genuine. I
    took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole
    business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life,
    walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out of it
    with another man's cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he
    was quite easy and sneering. 'Set your mind at rest,' says he, 'I
    will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.'
    So we all set off, the doctor, and the child's father, and our
    friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers;
    and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I
    gave in the check myself, and said I had every reason to believe it
    was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine."

    "Tut-tut," said Mr. Utterson.

    "I see you feel as I do," said Mr. Enfield. "Yes, it's a bad story.
    For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really
    damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink
    of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of
    your fellows who do what they call good. Black-mail, I suppose; an
    honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his
    youth. Black-Mail House is what I call that place with the door, in
    consequence. Though even that, you know, is far from explaining
    all," he added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing.

    From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly:
    "And you don't know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?"

    "A likely place, isn't it?" returned Mr. Enfield. "But I happen to
    have noticed his address; he lives in some square or other."

    "And you never asked about the--place with the door?" said Mr.
    Utterson.

    "No, sir: I had a delicacy," was the reply. "I feel very strongly
    about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the
    day of judgment. You start a question, and it's like starting a
    stone. You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone
    goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last
    you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own
    back-garden and the family have to change their name. No, sir, I
    make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the
    less I ask."

    "A very good rule, too," said the lawyer.

    "But I have studied the place for myself," continued Mr. Enfield.
    "It seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes
    in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of
    my adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the
    first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they're
    clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so
    somebody must live there. And yet it's not so sure; for the
    buildings are so packed together about that court, that it's hard to
    say where one ends and another begins."

    The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then,
    "Enfield," said Mr. Utterson, "that's a good rule of yours."

    "Yes, I think it is," returned Enfield.

    "But for all that," continued the lawyer, "there's one point I want
    to ask: I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the
    child."

    "Well," said Mr. Enfield, "I can't see what harm it would do. It
    was a man of the name of Hyde."

    "H'm," said Mr. Utterson. "What sort of a man is he to see?"

    "He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his
    appearance; something displeasing, something downright detestable. I
    never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be
    deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although
    I couldn't specify the point. He's an extraordinary-looking man, and
    yet I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no
    hand of it; I can't describe him. And it's not want of memory; for I
    declare I can see him this moment."

    Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a
    weight of consideration.

    "You are sure he used a key?" he inquired at last.

    "My dear sir..." began Enfield, surprised out of himself.

    "Yes, I know," said Utterson; "I know it must seem strange. The
    fact is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is
    because I know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone
    home. If you have been inexact in any point, you had better correct
    it."

    "I think you might have warned me," returned the other, with a
    touch of sullenness. "But I have been pedantically exact, as you
    call it. The fellow had a key; and what's more, he has it still. I
    saw him use it, not a week ago."

    Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man
    presently resumed. "Here is another lesson to say nothing," said he.
    "I am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to
    refer to this again."

    "With all my heart," said the lawyer. "I shake hands on that,
    Richard."

    That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre
    spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of
    a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a
    volume of some dry divinity on his reading-desk, until the clock of
    the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would
    go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night, however, as soon as
    the cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his
    business-room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private
    part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll's Will,
    and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was
    holograph, for Mr. Utterson, though he took charge of it now that it
    was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of
    it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry
    Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were
    to pass into the hands of his "friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,"
    but that in case of
    Dr. Jekyll's "disappearance or unexplained absence for any period
    exceeding three calendar months," the said Edward Hyde should step
    into the said Henry Jekyll's shoes without further delay and free
    from any burthen or obligation, beyond the payment of a few small
    sums to the members of the doctor's household. This document had
    long been the lawyer's eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and
    as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the
    fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr.
    Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was
    his knowledge. It was already bad enough when the name was but a
    name of which he could learn no more. It was worse when it began to
    be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting,
    insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped
    up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend.

    "I thought it was madness," he said, as he replaced the obnoxious
    paper in the safe, "and now I begin to fear it is disgrace."

    With that he blew out his candle, put on a great-coat, and set
    forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of
    medicine, where his friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and
    received his crowding patients. "If any one knows, it will be
    Lanyon," he had thought.

    The solemn butler knew and welcomed him;
    he was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the
    door to the dining-room where Dr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine.
    This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a
    shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided
    manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up from his chair and
    welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was the way of the
    man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine
    feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at school
    and college, both thorough respecters of themselves and of each
    other, and, what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed
    each other's company.

    After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject
    which so disagreeably pre-occupied his mind.

    "I suppose, Lanyon," said he "you and I must be the two oldest
    friends that Henry Jekyll has?"

    "I wish the friends were younger," chuckled Dr. Lanyon. "But I
    suppose we are. And what of that? I see little of him now."


    "Indeed?" said Utterson. "I thought you had a bond of common
    interest."

    "We had," was the reply. "But it is more than ten years since Henry
    Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in
    mind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for
    old sake's sake, as they say,
    I see and I have seen devilish little of the man. Such unscientific
    balderdash," added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, "would have
    estranged Damon and Pythias."

    This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr.
    Utterson. "They have only differed on some point of science," he
    thought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the
    matter of conveyancing), he even added: "It is nothing worse than
    that!" He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure,
    and then approached the question he had come to put. "Did you ever
    come across a protege of his--one Hyde?" he asked.

    "Hyde?" repeated Lanyon. "No. Never heard of him. Since my time."

    That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back
    with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro,
    until the small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a
    night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness
    and besieged by questions.

    Six o'clock struck on the bells of the church that was so
    conveniently near to Mr. Utterson's dwelling, and still he was
    digging at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the
    intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged,
    or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness
    of the night and the curtained room, Mr. Enfield's tale went by
    before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. He would be aware
    of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure
    of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor's;
    and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down
    and passed on regardless of her screams. Or else he would see a room
    in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling
    at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the
    curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo!
    there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and
    even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure
    in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time
    he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through
    sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more
    swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted
    city, and at every street-corner crush a child and leave her
    screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know
    it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and
    melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and
    grew apace in the lawyer's mind a singularly strong, almost an
    inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde.
    If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would
    lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of
    mysterious
    things when well examined. He might see a reason for his friend's
    strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even
    for the startling clause of the will. At least it would be a face
    worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a
    face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the
    unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred.

    From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the
    by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when
    business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of the
    fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or
    concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.

    "If he be Mr. Hyde," he had thought, "I shall be Mr. Seek."

    And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night;
    frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the
    lamps, unshaken, by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light
    and shadow. By ten o'clock, when the shops were closed, the
    by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of
    London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far;
    domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either
    side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any
    passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some
    minutes at his post, when he was
    aware of an odd, light footstep drawing near. In the course of his
    nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect
    with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a
    great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and
    clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so
    sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong,
    superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry
    of the court.

    The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as
    they turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from
    the entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with.
    He was small and very plainly dressed, and the look of him, even at
    that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher's
    inclination. But he made straight for the door, crossing the
    roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket
    like one approaching home.

    Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he
    passed. "Mr. Hyde, I think?"

    Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his
    fear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in
    the face, he answered coolly enough: "That is my name. What do you
    want?"

    "I see you are going in," returned the lawyer. "I am an old friend
    of Dr. Jekyll's -- Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street -- you must have
    heard my name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might
    admit me."

    "You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home," replied Mr. Hyde,
    blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,
    "How did you know me?" he asked.

    "On your side," said Mr. Utterson, "will you do me a favour?"

    "With pleasure," replied the other. "What shall it be?"

    "Will you let me see your face?" asked the lawyer.

    Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden
    reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair
    stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. "Now I shall
    know you again," said Mr. Utterson. "It may be useful."

    "Yes," returned Mr. Hyde, "it is as well we have, met; and a
    propos, you should have my address." And he gave a number of a
    street in Soho.

    "Good God!" thought Mr. Utterson, "can he, too, have been thinking
    of the will?" But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted
    in acknowledgment of the address.

    "And now," said the other, "how did you know me?"

    "By description," was the reply.

    "Whose description?"

    "We have common friends," said Mr. Utterson.

    "Common friends?" echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. "Who are
    they?"

    "Jekyll, for instance," said the lawyer.

    "He never told you," cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. "I did
    not think you would have lied."

    "Come," said Mr. Utterson, "that is not fitting language."


    The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment,
    with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and
    disappeared into the house.

    The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of
    disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing
    every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in
    mental perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked,
    was one of a class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and
    dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable
    malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to
    the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and
    boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken
    voice; all these were points against him, but not all of these
    together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing, and
    fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. "There must be something
    else," said the perplexed gentleman. "There is something
    more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems
    hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be the
    old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul
    that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent?
    The last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read
    Satan's signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend."

    Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,
    handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high
    estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of
    men: map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers, and the agents of
    obscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was
    still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great
    air of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness
    except for the fan-light, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A
    well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door.

    "Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?" asked the lawyer.

    "I will see, Mr. Utterson," said Poole, admitting the visitor, as
    he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall, paved with
    flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright,
    open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. "Will you
    wait here by the
    fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining room?"

    "Here, thank you," said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on
    the tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a
    pet fancy of his friend the doctor's; and Utterson himself was wont
    to speak of it as the pleasantest room in London. But to-night there
    was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his
    memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of
    life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in
    the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the
    uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his
    relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll
    was gone out.

    "I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting-room door, Poole," he
    said. "Is that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?"

    "Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir," replied the servant. "Mr. Hyde
    has a key."

    "Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young
    man, Poole," resumed the other musingly.

    "Yes, sir, he do indeed," said Poole. "We have all orders to obey
    him."

    "I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?" asked Utterson.


    "O, dear no, sir. He never dines here," replied the butler. "Indeed
    we see very little of
    him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and goes by the
    laboratory."

    "Well, good-night, Poole."

    "Good-night, Mr. Utterson." And the lawyer set out homeward with a
    very heavy heart. "Poor Harry Jekyll," he thought, "my mind
    misgives me he is in deep waters! He was wild when he was young; a
    long while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no
    statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old
    sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming,
    _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the
    fault." And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded a while on
    his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, lest by chance
    some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there.
    His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their
    life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the
    many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and
    fearful gratitude by the many that he had come so near to doing, yet
    avoided. And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a
    spark of hope. "This Master Hyde, if he were studied," thought he,
    "must have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him;
    secrets compared to which poor Jekyll's worst would be like
    sunshine. Things cannot continue as they are. It turns me cold to
    think of this creature stealing like a
    thief to Harry's bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening! And the
    danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the will,
    he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulder to the
    wheel if Jekyll will but let me," he added, "if Jekyll will only let
    me." For once more he saw before his mind's eye, as clear as a
    transparency, the strange clauses of the will.
